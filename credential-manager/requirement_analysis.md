# Credential Manager Application Requirements Analysis

## Core Features

### 1. Secure Credential Storage
- Implement encryption for all stored credentials
- Ensure credentials are only accessible to authorized users
- Store encrypted credentials in MySQL database

### 2. Client Management
- Create, read, update, and delete client records
- Associate credentials with specific clients
- Allow filtering and searching of clients

### 3. Platform Categorization
- Support multiple platform types (GoDaddy, Namecheap, HostGator, WordPress, Azure, etc.)
- Allow custom platform types to be added
- Group credentials by platform for easy management

### 4. User Role-Based Access Control
- Implement different user roles (Admin, Manager, User)
- Admin: Full access to all features and settings
- Manager: Access to assigned clients and their credentials
- User: Limited access based on permissions

### 5. Activity Logging
- Log all user actions for audit purposes
- Record timestamp, user, action type, and affected resource
- Allow filtering and searching of logs

### 6. Excel Export Functionality
- Export all credentials or filtered subsets
- Include client information in exports
- Format exports for readability and usability
- Implement secure export process

### 7. Responsive UI
- Ensure application works on desktop and mobile devices
- Implement responsive design principles
- Optimize UI for different screen sizes

## Technical Requirements

### Backend (Node.js, Express.js)
- RESTful API architecture
- JWT authentication
- Middleware for role-based access control
- Encryption/decryption services
- Database connection and ORM
- Logging service
- Export service

### Frontend (React.js)
- Component-based architecture
- State management
- Form validation
- Responsive design
- Authentication flows
- Data visualization for dashboard

### Database (MySQL)
- Users table
- Clients table
- Platforms table
- Credentials table (encrypted)
- Activity logs table
- Roles and permissions tables

### Security Considerations
- Password hashing for user authentication
- JWT with appropriate expiration
- Encryption for sensitive data
- HTTPS for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection)

### Containerization (Docker)
- Separate containers for frontend, backend, and database
- Docker Compose for orchestration
- Environment variable management
- Volume mapping for persistent data
